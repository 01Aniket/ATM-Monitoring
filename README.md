-> Flask Application which monitors different sensors(Ex: Smoke Sensor, PIR
Motion Sensor etc.) , Person Count and Face Detection.

-> This application runs on Raspberry Pi, I have used Rest API to handle
requests and send data.

-> Using OpenCV, Keras, Tesorflow I have developed a model which detects covered
faces as well as gives live person count.
